# About the game

Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish. 
each roll result is added to a current total. 
player loses his current gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
until rolled a 1 player can decide to roll again or hold and secure his current score into his total
score.
holding score will pass the turn to the other player.

first to hold 100 points wins the game!
